## Physiology
### Source of EEG
* The first a few pages of "François Grimbert, Olivier Faugeras. Analysis of Jansen’s model of a single cortical column. [Research Report](https://rachel-sunrui.github.io/assets/Resume_afterPhD.pdf) RR-5597, INRIA. 2006, pp.34."
* From [scholarpedia](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Electroencephalogram):
    * Current consists of movement of positive and negative ions in opposite directions, but the total charge in any mesoscopic tissue volume is essentially zero. 
    * Height: 2-5 mm
    * Diameter: 30 $$\mu m$$ to 1 mm (But I think from other references, the diameter is ususally on the order of 100 $$\mu m$$)
* From [wikipedia]:(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_column)
    Various estimates suggest there are 50 to 100 cortical minicolumns in a hypercolumn, each comprising around 80 neurons. Their role is best understood as 'functional units of information processing.
