## Statistical power
* From the ```The_Essential_Guide_to_Effect_Size```
* Defined as the probability that it will reject a false null hypothesis
* Inversely related to the probability of making a Type II error (The nul is wrong, but did not reject it $$\beta$$). In short, power = 1 â€“ $$\beta$$.
* Statistical power is affected chiefly by the size of the effect and the size of the sample used to detect it. Bigger effects are easier to detect than smaller effects, while large samples offer greater test sensitivity than small samples.
