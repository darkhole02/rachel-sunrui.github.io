### Ringing artifacts

> These light and dark ripples are mainly due to the Gibbs phenomenon as the Fourier sums overshoot at discontinuities (i.e., image edges), and this overshoot does not die out while the frequency increases. This phenomenon can be amplified if the noise Ï‰ is not modeled accurately and if the blur kernal is noisy or inaccurately estimated. The latter case is even more serious in blind deconvolution approaches that involve kernal estimation from the blurred image"
