1. Go to settings, search for Inspections (Under Editor, Code style)
2. Find and click PEP8 code style violation. In the right panel, there is *ignore errors* option. 
3. Find the error code of interest, e.g. *E501 line too long* [here](https://pep8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html#configuration), and paste the code to Pycharm.
4. Ok the setting.
