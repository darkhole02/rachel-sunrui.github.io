Jupyter notebook can combine text and code. When you are study new things and take notes, it could be really helpful. The steps are:

1. Make sure you have Anacoda and Matlab installed. Python is added to the PATH.(Python can be called from the command window.)
2. Install [Matlab python engine](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html) 
3. Install metakernel, matlab_kernel, and pymatbridge. For instance, open Anaconda prompt and run
`pip install metakernel`

Now you can open Jupyter notebook and see Matlab as a language!
