### Verhoeven, Thibault, et al. “Automated Diagnosis of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy in the Absence of Interictal Spikes.” NeuroImage: Clinical, vol. 17, Elsevier, Jan. 2018, pp. 10–15, doi:10.1016/J.NICL.2017.09.021.

* What is the goal of the paper? What is the problem they are trying to solve?
    * Diagnosis and Laterization of the TLE patients
* What are the significance?
    * functional connectivity using EEG without scalp pathological activity can be used for automatic diagnosis and lateralization of TLE.
    * 1 min of artefact-free EEG, extracted from a 10- to 15 min recording, which is less time-consuming than other imaging modalities.
* What are the main technique they are using? How did they solve the problem?
    * Using EEG-based directed functional connectivity
    * Subjects underwent a resting-state eyes-closed recording during presurgical evaluation. 
    * Sixty epochs of 1 s, free of artefacts and IEDs, during wakefulness were selected per subject. 
    * Random forest
* What are the important results or knowledge?
    * The hippocampus has a pivotal role in the generation of interictal and ictal activity in the majority of TLE cases.

* What are the problems in the paper?
    * What about patients for ILAE3-5, and for those that is not laterizated. Quote: especially in difficult cases where the currently used presurgical evaluation methods are not concordant.  --> not true
* How to improve?
